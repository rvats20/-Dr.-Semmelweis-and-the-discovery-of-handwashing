# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the historical account of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis and his groundbreaking discovery of the importance of handwashing in medical practice. Dr. Semmelweis's work significantly reduced the incidence of puerperal fever and laid the foundation for modern antiseptic procedures.

## Background
In the mid-19th century, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, observed a high mortality rate among women giving birth in hospitals. He hypothesized that the transmission of infectious material from doctors' hands to patients was the cause. By introducing a strict handwashing protocol using chlorinated lime solutions, he drastically reduced the mortality rate.
